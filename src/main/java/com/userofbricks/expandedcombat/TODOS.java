        anchantment idea:
        ad an upgraded form of enchanting space.
        don't change the enchanting block
        add instead bookshelf replacements
        when these replacements are around the table the gui of the enchanting table will change
        this will allow acsess to far more powerfull enchantment capabilities but at a much higher cost (lapis Blocks instead of the item)
        the upgraded bookshelves will be togleable to allow acces to normal enchantments
