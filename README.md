## Content
### Quiver and Arrows
the quiver is an item that when put into a custom inventory slot unlocks an extra arrow slot for your 
arrow needs. The arrows in this slot will be used first before taking out of your main inventory. There are also iron, 
diamond, and Netherite arrows available in both regular and tipped forms. these increase in damage as the material gets 
more expencive. The mod changes the texture and name of the vanilla arrow to look more consistently like a flint arrow 
as the current arrow already looks too much like an Iron one.
### Gauntlets
Gauntlets that serve as both armor and an increase in damage. These can be equipped using the Curios Hands slot.
They can also be enchanted to provide knock back and/or knock back resistance. 
### Shield progression
the Shield progression is the most detailed part of this mod with lots of veriety and end results.

The current system is a 4 "slot" system with crafting done in the smithing table. The current materials are iron(1 slot),
gold (2 slots), diamond (1 slot), and netherite wich can be aplied once there are a minimum of 3 diamonds on the shield.
all applied materials increase the durability of the shield though gold does this only a little bit.
Gold can be used to increase the shields mending capability once the mending enchanment is applied.
Diamond counteracts this a small amount though. They can also replace already applied gold and iron but can't be aplied
till at least one gold or iron ingot has been applied.
### Bow Progression
The Bow progression for this mod is very similar to the shield progression though it oly has 2 slots. 
As the bow progresses it gets a longer range though you want to be careful as having the bow unbalaced with different 
materials in each slot causes the bow to shoot poorly.

### Meele Weapons
There are a vast number of weapons in this mod reanging from swords and scythes to hammers and maces. All the different types have varying stregths and weeknesses that are all(with one exception) viewable in the tooltips of the items. There are many atributes to each including damage range, enhanced damage, slow/fast, and rate of repair for mending. The one weapon whos greatest strength is not shown in a tool tip is the Scythe wich similarly to arrows you can craft with potions and it will deal out that potion on hit.
