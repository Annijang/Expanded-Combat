## Content
### Quiver and Arrows
the quiver is an item that when put into a custom inventory slot (found in the Curios menu) unlocks extra arrow slots for your 
arrow needs. The arrows in this slot will be used first before taking out of your main inventory. There are also iron, 
diamond, and Netherite arrows available in both regular and tipped forms. these increase in damage as the material gets 
more expensive. The mod changes the texture and name of the vanilla arrow to look more consistently like a flint arrow 
as the current arrow already looks too much like an Iron one. Along with this you can now cycle the arrows in the quiver
to change which stack is used first. To do this click the Hotkeys Z and X. There is also a hud display that sows you the
first stack to be used along with the last stack and next one. This display is only shown if you are holding a bow or 
crossbow and appears next to your offhand slot.
### Gauntlets
Gauntlets that serve as both armor and an increase in damage. These can be equipped using the Curios Hands slot. 
They can also be enchanted to provide knock back and/or knock back resistance. However, when holding a weapon of any kind 
the damage they add gets cut in half.
### Shield progression
the Shield progression is the most detailed part of this mod with lots of veriety and end results.

The current system is a 5 "slot" system with crafting done in the smithing table. 
All applied materials increase the durability of the shield with the amount changing based on the material.
Each Material can be used to increase or decrease the shields mending capability once the mending enchantment is applied.
Materials can get replaced however you do not get the previous material back. Some materials require specific materials 
to already be on the shield in order to be placed on it. an example of this is netherite which requires diamond before 
it and will only replace diamond. materials such as netherite (currently netherite is the only one) only require one 
ingot to replace all diamond slots in the shield. if you have jei installed you will se these recipes with it.
### Bow/Crossbow Progression
The Bow progression for this mod is similar to the shield progression though it is more linear. 
As the bow progresses it gets a longer range though you want to be careful as having the bow unbalanced with different 
materials in each slot causes the bow to shoot suboptimally.

### Melee Weapons
There are a vast number of weapons in this mod ranging from swords and scythes to hammers and maces. All the different 
types have varying strengths and weaknesses that are all(with one exception) viewable in the tooltips of the items. There 
are many attributes to each including damage, range, attack speed, and rate of repair for mending. The one weapon 
who's greatest strength is not shown in a tool tip is the Scythe which similarly to arrows you can craft with potions, and it 
will deal out that potion on hit.

### Configurability
Nearly everything in this mod is configurable. from item damage amounts to crafting type to enchantability.
