# Expanded-Combat
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Mod Adds A few things to expand the resources you have for combat. First of all It has a quiver which can be put into a custom inventory slot to allow you to more easily say which arrows you want to be used first rather than having to use the offhand so often. it also adds staged arrows: iron, diamond, and Netherite will be available in 1.16 once updated. All the arrows have tipped versions so you don't have to worry there. Also The mod changes the texture and name of the vanilla arrow to look more consistently like a flint arrow as the current arrow already looks too much like an Iron one. The mod also adds a few Gauntlets that serve as both armor and and increase in damage. These Gauntlets have a third use for knock back and knock back resistance through enchanting. The gauntlets can be equipped using the Curios Hands slot.</p>

<p>version 2.0.0 of this mod adds a few more things such as bow progression and shield progression. the shield progression is far more complex as it has many, many end products all with different looks and fetures. (a video is planed to show this updates contents)</p>
